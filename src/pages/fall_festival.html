<h2>Please join us!</h2>
<b>PURPOSE:</b> This is a non-competitive festival, now in its 29<sup>th</sup> year, which provides musical growth through
evaluation and encouragement. The teacher and <u>one</u> parent are welcome to attend the performance.<br><br>
One of the goals of the Fall Festival is to have the students master and perform two (2) pieces that are
contrasting in style, mood and musical era.<br><br><br>

<b>ELIGIBILITY:</b> Teachers may submit students at elementary, intermediate and advanced levels.<br>
<u>Important Note</u>: Because scheduling is complex, teachers who enter a large number of
students may not be able to attend all performances.<br><br>
All teachers who submit students are required to volunteer their time to help with the
Festival. (See volunteer form). Each teacher must submit a separate $50 “duty deposit”
check in addition to registration fees. This check will be returned when the teacher

<li> The student will be asked to play a scale for each piece.</li>
